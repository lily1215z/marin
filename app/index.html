              Global goods movement is a critical element in the global freight transportation system that
              includes ocean and coastal routes, inland waterways, railways, roads, and air freight. In some cases, the
              freight transportation network connects locations by multiple modal routes, functioning as modal
              substitutes.
              International maritime transportation is more commonly a complement to other modes of transportation. This
              is particularly true for intercontinental containerized cargoes and for liquid and dry
              bulk cargoes, such as oil and grain. Here, international shipping connects roads, railways, and inland
              waterways through ocean and coastal routes.
              Mode choice (especially for containerized cargo movement) involves balancing tradeoffs to facilitate trade
              among global corporations and nations. In the current global economy, competing factors have been time,
              cost, and reliability of delivery. Low cost modes may be less preferred than faster modes if the cargo is
              very time sensitive; however, slower, lower cost modes often carry much more cargo and, with proper
              planning, these modes can reliably deliver larger quantities to meet just-in-time inventory needs.
              Analogous to a relay race, all modes are needed to deliver containerized cargo from the starting line to
              the finish line.
              Mode share in freight transportation can be measured in several ways, but a common metric is in
              terms of the work done in cargo tonne-kilometers (tkm).
              Marine transportation is an integral, if sometimes less publicly visible, part of the global
              economy. The marine transportation system is a network of specialized vessels, the ports they visit, and
              transportation infrastructure from factories to terminals to distribution centers to markets. Maritime
              transportation is a necessary complement to and occasional substitute for other modes of freight
              transportation. For many commodities and trade routes, there is no direct substitute for waterborne
              commerce. Globalization is motivated by the recognition that resources and goods are not always collocated
              with the populations that desire them, and so global transportation services are needed.
